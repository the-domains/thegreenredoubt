            <title><![CDATA[The Butterfly Collector]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Butterfly Collector</h1><p>Heliconids always reminded Angie of faces painted with cam cream; two pairs of oval black wings, the front ones more elongated, the back ones more rounded, interrupted by narrow streaks of white and vermilion. Not that the description ‘black’ did them justice; the wings were formed of a plush, velvety ‘absence’ that threatened to suck you in and hide you away. Combined with the streaks they mimicked the interference pattern you’d use to conceal your face in the jungle, like you were Arnie eluding the Predator. And if there was one thing she understood these days, it was camouflage; she’d made a study of it, quite out of necessity of course, after she came back from the Ukraine.</p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Put A Coin On The Brim Of My Hat]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In the beginning it was
dark, silent and I had no sense of smell. Neither had I any means to gauge the
passage of time. I must have slept long and slept often, for seldom had I any
awareness of myself and when that did come it rushed out of nowhere and left me
startled, like the sleeper awakened by a single clap of thunder in the middle
of the night, who sits up in the bed with a pounding heart, bleary-eyed and
puzzled. The very experience so drained me that I lapsed back into
unconsciousness almost immediately and I suppose I remained that way until the
next jolt came.</p>]]></description>
