<h1>The Butterfly Collector</h1><p>Heliconids always reminded Angie of faces painted with cam cream; two pairs of oval black wings, the front ones more elongated, the back ones more rounded, interrupted by narrow streaks of white and vermilion. Not that the description ‘black’ did them justice; the wings were formed of a plush, velvety ‘absence’ that threatened to suck you in and hide you away. Combined with the streaks they mimicked the interference pattern you’d use to conceal your face in the jungle, like you were Arnie eluding the Predator. And if there was one thing she understood these days, it was camouflage; she’d made a study of it, quite out of necessity of course, after she came back from the Ukraine.</p><p>‘Which one is it, exactly?’ asked Chris.</p><p>‘It’s <em>Heliconius erato</em>,’ she replied, matter-of-factly. ‘There are loads of Heliconids and they all look pretty much the same apart from the size and shape of the streaks.’</p><p>‘So how do you know it’s <em>erato</em>, rather than <em>melpomene</em>, for example?’</p><p>‘<em>Melpomene</em> has an extra streak on the underside,’ she responded instantly.</p><p>‘Erato was a Greek goddess, you know.’</p><p>‘Well not exactly,’ she corrected him tetchily, ‘Erato was only a demi-goddess; she was the muse of lyric poetry.’</p><p>‘Oh.’ Chris sounded a little deflated and quickly changed the subject. ‘And what’s the one just below that and to the left?’</p><p>She glanced down at the butterfly he indicated. It was slightly smaller than the Heliconid, with rounder wings. The ground colour was a rich cream, overlaid with an array of markings in charcoal, carmine and cobalt, notably at the wing edges which were adorned with intricate zigzags and tiny eyespots.</p><p>‘It’s <em>Zerynthia polyxena</em>, from France, I…’</p><p>‘And the one underneath that?’ he interrupted her. ‘I can just see one forewing, with some purple on it.’</p><p>She grinned, knowing full well the implications of his question.</p><p>‘It’s the first one I ever got; <em>Sasakia charonda</em>; a Japanese emperor.’</p><p>‘Well let’s have a look!’</p><p>She waited for a few seconds after the text had appeared in the chat window on her screen, just to tease him. He had paid well; cleared half the items from her Amazon wish list, so there was no way she was going to rip him off. She adjusted the webcam slightly, to make sure that when she knelt on the mattress she was positioned in the centre of the frame, then shrugged the loose, dragon-printed silk dressing gown off her shoulders, letting it fall down to her waist. She was wearing nothing underneath. Her skin held an even, flawless tan that gave it the appearance of latex. She was muscular too; more than you’d expect, unless you attended the same gym and had seen her boxing. The Japanese emperor came fully into view; a vivid splash of metallic purplish-green on black, just below her rib cage, a little off-centre to the right. She had chosen it to remind her of Yamashita-San, her first ever client.</p><p>She ran her elegantly manicured fingers lightly over her small rounded breasts, brushing her nipples, making them stand half-erect. It was all part of the show. Chris’s chat window had gone silent. She pictured him kneading his cock in a dingy room somewhere, half-way around the world. ‘Hopefully not as dingy as this garret,’ she mused, looking around her at the peeling, pale-yellow emulsion on the mould-spotted walls. Her little black dress and her tote bag hung on a single bent nail stuck in the back of a patched-up wooden door. An oversized teddy-bear, with a forlorn expression, sat atop a stack of worn, stained pillows at the other end of a cheap mattress which was strewn with a bewildering array of dildos and vibrators in shocking pink and electric blue. The whole scene was lit by a single harsh light bulb. ‘Vermin’ was an apt name for the place; just one of a dozen sleazy clubs that occupied the cheaply-converted railway sheds in the disused sidings on the east side of Namasnya Town. A little earlier she’d been pole-dancing for the punters several floors below and now she was up here on the cams.</p><p>There was still no response in the chat, so she checked her make-up in a cracked mirror that hung at an angle on the wall just behind her sleek flat-screened monitor. Her green-dyed hair was cut in a bob, gently spiked up with a little gel and with a long v-shaped fringe at the front that fell forwards between her hard, dark eyes as far as the bridge of her nose. Her temples and cheekbones were decorated with a geometric pattern of blusher in dark, medium and pale flesh tones; urban camouflage.</p><p>‘V e r y n i c e,’ came up in the chat window finally. Chris had spaced the letters wide for effect and added a smiley.</p><p>She pulled the gown open a little more so that he could see her pierced navel and half the wing of another Heliconid; tugged it along her thighs a few centimetres too, so that he could see the tops of her stockings. Then she looked brazenly right into the cam, winked and licked her lips.</p><p>‘The Darknet is full of rumours about you.’</p><p>She froze. This was a twist in the conversation she had not anticipated and though she doubted that it was indeed, ‘full,’ equally it was unlikely that there was nothing there at all.</p><p>‘What do you mean?’ she managed to type into the keyboard in front of her; churning inside, whilst doing her best to keep her outward composure sunny.</p><p>‘It’s taken me weeks to find you.’</p><p>‘You’ve been industrious then.’</p><p>‘I’d love you to see my Desert Eagles.’</p><p>‘You collect guns?’ She knew she should kill the link now but she didn’t, hoping that she could find out something more about those rumours.</p><p>‘I know where you live. Shall I come over?’</p><p>‘Do you?’ She was sure he didn’t; knew the Amazon shipping address she used was just the front for a very discreet, very secure forwarding service hundreds of kilometres away in Amsterdam. Nevertheless, his tone disturbed her.</p><p>‘I want to give you a butterfly of my own. Something you can point to and think “That one was from Chris.”‘</p><p>The import of what he had just said took a few seconds to sink in but when it did, she slammed the panic button on the little console by the keyboard and cut the channel stone dead.</p><p>Heart pounding, she staggered to her feet and pulled the dressing gown up around her. She went to her tote bag hanging on the door and felt for the handgun inside. It was nothing more than a reflex but the simple act of touching its cool solidity calmed her down. She left it there, opened the door and stepped out, locking it again behind her. She tiptoed in her stockinged feet along the rickety, splintered floorboards of the corridor, past the closed doors of another half-dozen rooms just like the one she had emerged from, until she got to the shared bathroom. Thankfully it was unoccupied. Inside she stripped quickly and stepped into the shower, treading carefully to avoid cutting her feet on any of the broken tiles. The water was cold, but she didn’t mind; it was a sticky, humid night. She just wanted to get that encounter out of her system, knock off and head home. She turned the tap full on so that she was drenched under the pressure. It was an invigorating, cleansing sensation.</p><p>Her fingertips drifted to the first of her butterfly tattoos; the Japanese emperor. It had almost become a ritual for her to touch them one by one when she was naked and as she did so, she whispered her own special mantra to herself. She felt the ridged, uneven skin beneath the design; the scar tissue from the wound it concealed. In her mind she saw the moment the motorbike had roared up, as she and Yamashita-San were leaving the exclusive Tokyo sushi-bar after some late night business. She saw too the helmeted assassin swinging his machine pistol around in their direction and relived the instant she had leapt, simultaneously knocking her employer to one side, shielding him and emptying her gun into the assailant.</p><p>Each time her fingers passed from one butterfly to the next, the accompanying scene came flooding back into her mind. Lastly she got to the three Heliconids and was transported back to the night she had acquired them all; that insane fire-fight with the Ukrainian security forces inside the Chernobyl exclusion zone. By rights she should be dead; but she wasn’t.</p><p>Finally feeling clean again, she stepped out of the shower, gathered up her things and padded naked along the corridor back to her room, slowly whispering her mantra as she walked:</p><p>‘Nine bullets, nine wounds, nine butterflies.’</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="52"><!-- react-empty: 53 --></div></section><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-1 p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title  color-bg text-align-left  colors-black colors-global " data-reactid="54"><div class="Component p-1 " data-reactid="55"><div class="Group Group--graphical max-w-768px p-1 m-h-a" data-reactid="56"><a class="" data-reactid="57"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="58"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="59"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/dbfdcdedba6604a30a5779ad82b6e2b9/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fe5ee785c940e10e61b3d5fec4c04f042ca0a9435.jpg&amp;width=899" style="object-position:88.2091212458287% 78.45849802371542%;" data-reactid="60"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/dbfdcdedba6604a30a5779ad82b6e2b9/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fe5ee785c940e10e61b3d5fec4c04f042ca0a9435.jpg&amp;width=899" style="object-position:88.2091212458287% 78.45849802371542%;" data-reactid="61"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/8596ec260ebe32e0f9f62845295707e5/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fe5ee785c940e10e61b3d5fec4c04f042ca0a9435.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:88.2091212458287% 78.45849802371542%;" data-reactid="62"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a0a96d7f32dc7a96978f3b4253a11181/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fe5ee785c940e10e61b3d5fec4c04f042ca0a9435.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:88.2091212458287% 78.45849802371542%;" data-reactid="63"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="899" data-height="506" data-ratio="1.7766798418972332" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/dbfdcdedba6604a30a5779ad82b6e2b9/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fe5ee785c940e10e61b3d5fec4c04f042ca0a9435.jpg&amp;width=899" style="object-position:88.2091212458287% 78.45849802371542%;" data-reactid="64"/></picture></div></a><!-- react-empty: 65 --><!-- react-empty: 66 --></div></div></section><section id="5" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-medium p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="67"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-1 " data-reactid="68"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 max-w-768px m-a" data-reactid="69"><!-- react-empty: 70 --><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="71"><h1 data-reactid="72"><span class=" color-box-pop" data-reactid="73"><a class="font-title" data-reactid="74">Put A Coin On The Brim Of My Hat</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 75 --><!-- react-empty: 76 --><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="77"><p data-reactid="78">In the beginning it was dark, silent and I had no sense of smell. Neither had I any means to gauge the passage of time. I must have slept long and slept often, for seldom had I any awareness of myself and when that did come it rushed out of nowhere and left me startled, like the sleeper awakened by a single clap of thunder in the middle of the night, who sits up in the bed with a pounding heart, bleary-eyed and puzzled. The very experience so drained me that I lapsed back into unconsciousness almost immediately and I suppose I remained that way until the next jolt came.</p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="79"><p data-reactid="80">Over time – months, years, decades, I had no way of measuring – I began to feel less weak when this happened and finally the day arrived when I was aware before the touch; when I felt the slightest tickle of electricity, first in my fingers as someone grasped my hand, then on my face as they rubbed my nose and lastly a blessed rush of energy that would once upon a time have been the force that waked me.</p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="81"><p data-reactid="82">Every touch that came was like the dose of a drug to me and each shot made me feel a fraction stronger and gave me hope that one day I could be whole again. One day I began to comprehend that there was a period during which I would be having this experience every few minutes, then there would be a gap, then it all started up again. This became my clock – the touching time was the day, the quiet time the night, though occasionally a touch came then too.</p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="83"><p data-reactid="84">One day I felt a small pressure on my head for the first time – this coming before the shake of my hand. Somehow I knew that the pressure came from the brim of my hat. Brim. Brim. Brimmer; I suddenly recalled that that was my name; in the old days after Denzil had first brought me to the castle, they had named me for my hat and, as had been the case at every new place I had visited throughout history, they partook of the ritual in the hope of gaining good luck.</p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="85"><p data-reactid="86">I had gone there because I had saved Denzil’s life. He granted me a boon in return and as a result the Order of the Stravaigers was established. To everyone else it was a charity to give assistance to other destitute wanderers who passed through the Principality. To me, it was an easy source of sustenance for almost a hundred years, until Waldteufel the lexicographer uncovered my secret and trapped me in this prison.</p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="87"><p data-reactid="88">I shall never forget the day that I began to see again. Admittedly it was a sepia-toned view of the world, as if a film of material remained in front of my eyes, but it was a view of the world nonetheless. And the first thing I saw was a beautiful young woman. She approached me laughing, turning her head to one side to say a word to the group of friends who loitered behind her, pointing, jostling and laughing too. Her long hair and striped dress rippled in the breeze. In her left hand she held a shiny coin. She moved in close to me and placed it on the brim of my hat. Then she shook my cold, unyielding hand and rubbed my stiff bronze nose. The rush came and then she took up the coin – I saw her hold it tight in one fist which she then kissed. She moved away. A couple of her friends patted her on the back, whilst another of them rooted around in his pocket for a coin of his own.</p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="89"><p data-reactid="90">Now I could watch it happen, over and over, always the same; coin – hand – nose – rush. The coin might then turn a purchase into a bargain, or become a wedding gift, or simply be wagered in a gambling den. They knew not that each time the ritual was performed a mote of their life force was transferred to me, to contribute to my next regeneration. In the weeks that followed, all of my memory began to return.</p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="91"><p data-reactid="92">I am the Wandering Dwarf. A relic from the dawn of time before the wargs came for the gods and Hati-Managarm ate the moon. My brethren were great smiths and used their gifts to construct mechanisms and magical things of immense power. My gift was different and I was cast out for it, exiled to wander the world of man for all eternity. Back then, I could suck the life force from a man in an instant and it would feed me for a week. Back then I was powerful. Back then, my name was not Brimmer.</p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="93"><p data-reactid="94">In another few months I could hear again. It was a rushing sound at first, like the sea in a shell but gradually the babble resolved itself into words, though more often than not I did not know the language being spoken. My eyesight improved. I could distinguish colours again. I knew to wait for the day when I could smell again, that would be the signal. That would be when I was strong enough to jump.</p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="95"><p data-reactid="96">I was almost caught unawares when it actually happened, so much had I become used to contemplating my imprisonment inside this statue. Again it was a girl and as she approached with her coin I noticed that she smelt of soap and apples.</p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="97"><p data-reactid="98">She smelt of soap and apples.</p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="99"><p data-reactid="100">Time to leave.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="6" class="Section Section--components-1 title-size-small color-title section-bgcover-wo p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-black colors-global " data-reactid="101"><div class="Component p-1 " data-reactid="102"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1 m-a" data-reactid="103"><div class="Cover ov-h pos-r" data-reactid="104"><button class="color-bg color-title pos-a circle w-4rem h-4rem center-hv m-0 cur-p" data-reactid="105"><span class="center-hv pos-a w-1rem h-1rem" data-reactid="106"><svg version="1.1" id="Layer_1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="409.7 414 32.1 34.5" enable-background="new 409.7 414 32.1 34.5" xml:space="preserve"><polygon class="color-icon-pop" fill="#fff" points="418.6,448.5 441.8,431.3 418.6,414 "/></svg></span></button><img class="cur-p m-b-1" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/17e687d239cb5f459ae9002459f7af41/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F69aada14e1546c3bf1706a238c5e338deaebbdd7.jpg&amp;width=1280" style="object-position:88.671875% 59.02777777777778%;" data-reactid="107"/></div></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 color-title" data-reactid="108"><!-- react-empty: 109 --><!-- react-empty: 110 --><!-- react-empty: 111 --><div class="max-w-560px" data-reactid="112"><!-- react-text: 113 --> <!-- /react-text --><!-- react-empty: 114 --><h3 class="m-t-1 m-b-05 font-title undefined" data-reactid="115"><span data-reactid="116">The Green Redoubt</span></h3><div class="Attribution color-title2 undefined" data-reactid="117"><h5 data-reactid="118"><span class="Author color-title2" data-reactid="119"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXtSicfSyZE4w2JI6E42MMg" data-reactid="120">Nick Larter</a><!-- react-text: 121 --> / <!-- /react-text --><a href="http://https://www.youtube.com/" data-reactid="122">YouTube</a></span></h5></div><div class="Paragraph l-h-m undefined" data-reactid="123">A trailer for my upcoming urban fantasy novel 'The Green Redoubt.'</div></div></div></div></section></div><section id="7" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="124"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="125"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="126"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="127"><span data-reactid="128"><!-- react-empty: 129 --><h2 data-reactid="130"><a data-reactid="131">thegreenredoubt</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="132"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="133"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="134"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="135"></div></section></div></div>
